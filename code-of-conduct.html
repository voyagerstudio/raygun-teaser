  <h2 class="coc__heading">Community Guidelines</h2>
  <p class="coc__updated-msg">Last updated by Shogun on <date>January 9th, 2020</date>
  </p>
  <p class="coc__lead">As a gaming community our goal is to create a friendly and inclusive home for casual players and competitive
    players alike. More than that, RGC strives to create a home for those who have been pushed out for who they are. RGC
    aims to set a standard that everyone can follow so no person feels left out under any circumstances.</p>
  <h3>The TLDR; Version</h3>
  <p>I get it, you're in a rush. This list operates as a guideline of what to expect from Ray Gun Club and what we
    expect of our members. It's not exhaustive and we intend to manage our community based on how we interpret what is
    fair and just.</p>
  <h4>Things We're Cool With</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being a part of other communities. We want you to be able to hang out with people you want to hang out with,
        wherever they might be.</li>
      <li>If you need to disappear for three months, we'll be here when you get back. </li>
      <li>Mainly sticking to just voice channels or just text channels. Wherever you're comfortable is cool with us,
        though we hope you make an effort to introduce yourself and get to know everyone. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Things We Won't Allow</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <!-- <li>Being under 21. RGC is a mature community, we expect that by joining you are at least 21 years old.</li> -->
      <li>Gratuitous or unwelcome sexual images, remarks, or advances</li>
      <li>threats or incitement of violence toward any individual or group of individuals including encouraging a person
        to commit suicide or self-harm</li>
      <li>Harassing, discriminatory, negative, or offensive behavior (or language) based on age, body size, disability,
        gender expression, gender identity, nationality, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, skin color, or
        socioeconomic status. This applies regardless of whether the message is targeted at an individual or a general group of people.</li>
      <li>Excessive meme posting. Here and there is cool but we think this makes for a more vibrant community in the end.</li>
      <li>Shock humor and humor at the expense of other groups.</li>
      <li>Intentionally or repeatedly referring to people in a way that rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance, by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).</li>
      <li>Retaliating against anyone who files a complaint that someone has violated this code of conduct.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>The Full Version</h3>
  <p>For those who are new to Ray Gun, first off we just want to say welcome and we can’t wait to get to know you. The
    members of Ray Gun Club have had the opportunity to build up real friendships over time and We totally get how that
    can be daunting when you first arrive. To create a space where everyone feels welcome to engage and take part, it
    takes a community that is all in on that goal. To achieve that here are some examples of behavior we hope you will
    and won’t see:</p>
  <h4>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Examples of unwelcoming behavior include:</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
      <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks</li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
      </li>
      <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a public environment</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Ray Gun Club is a community open to different points of view but this openness has its limits. Ray Gun Club will
    not accept any kind of language or behavior that infringes on the humanity of any of its members. The community will
    prioritize the safety of marginalized people over another person’s feelings of discomfort.</p>
  <h4>The following complaints will not be addressed:</h4>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Reverse”-isms, including “<a href="#" target="_blank">reverse racism</a>,” “reverse sexism,” “reverse <a
          href="#" target="_blank">colorism</a>”, and “cisphobia”</li>
      <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with
        you.”</li>
      <li>Communicating in a “tone” you don’t agree with</li>
      <li>Criticizing racist, colorist, classist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Enforcement</h3>
  <p>Participants asked to stop any inappropriate or harassing behavior must comply immediately.</p>
  <p>If a participant engages in behavior we believe is against the intent of the community guidelines or is deemed harmful to the community, the admins <em>will</em> take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender and up to and including expulsion from this community and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we’ve received complaints.</p>
